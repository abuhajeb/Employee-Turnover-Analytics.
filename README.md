# Employee-Turnover-Analytics.
Portobello Tech is an app innovator that has devised an intelligent way of predicting employee turnover within the company. It periodically evaluates employees' work details, including the number of projects they worked on, average monthly working hours, time spent in the company, promotions in the last 5 years, and salary level.

Data from prior evaluations show the employeesâ€™ satisfaction at the workplace.  The data could be used to identify patterns in work style and their interest in continuing to work in the company. 

The HR Department owns the data and uses it to predict employee turnover. Employee turnover refers to the total number of workers who leave a company over a certain time period.
